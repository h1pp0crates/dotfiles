# i3

This folder contains my personal configuration files for [i3](https://i3wm.org/), a tiling window manager for X11.

## Configuration

Edit the `config` file in this directory to customize keybindings, window layouts, and other i3 settings.  
After making changes, reload i3 with `Mod+Shift+R` (usually `Super+Shift+R`) to apply the new configuration.

## Installation

On Debian/Ubuntu, install i3 with:

```sh
sudo apt-get install i3
```

## Usage

Start i3 from your display manager or by running:

```sh
startx
```

Or select i3 from your login screen session options.

## More Info

See the [i3 documentation](https://i3wm.org/docs/) for details on configuration, keybindings, and advanced usage.
